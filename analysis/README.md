# Analysis results

This directory will contain the CSV-file with the raw results as published by the lecturers. All R code that was used to analyze and visualize the results is also stored here.

Do not make changes to the CSV-file. If it is necessary to clean up or edit the data, do so in R.

The results and conclusions of your research must be completely reproducible from your R code. The numbers and charts mentioned in your final paper must therefore appear when executing the scripts.
