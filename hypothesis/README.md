# Hypothesis

Use this directory to store the results of the first phase in the research, that is, the presentation summarizing the overview of your literature review, formulating the hypothesis and the independent variable you want to investigate.

The presentation is submitted on Chamilo as a PDF. We don't impose a source format, but leave the choice to the team. Powerpoint may be an obvious choice, but this file format is not suitable to keep in a Github repository. Alternatives could be a [LaTeX-beamer](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations) presentation, [Slide Presentations in RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html), [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), [Marp](https://marp.app/), etc.

Don't put too much time in learning how to work with an unfamiliar tool. The contents are what matters!
