# Meeting minutes

Use this directory to keep minutes of team meetings in **Markdown** files. We assume that what is written in a report is endorsed by the whole team. This can therefore count as proof that a student has made a contribution, even if this has not been demonstrated in Git commits.

We expect at least the meeting minutes of the reading group.

**Tips:**

- Start file names with the date in notation `yyyy-mm-dd`. That way, they are sorted chronologically.
- Instead of, or in addition to writing down action items in the report, you can also create Github issues and assign them to the team member responsible.
